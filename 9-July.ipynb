    "Range function is used to generate sequence and comes handy in loops. It uses 3 parameters (start_value, end_value, step_size). The start_value and step_size parameters are optional. Default value of start_value is 0 and default value of step_size is 1. The range always ends on value end_value-1. All the parameters need to be integer values and always checks for logical contunuity. Logical Continuity means, when start value is greater than end value, the step size has to be negative so that it follows logical sequence and vice versa when start value is greater than end value. Example of range function is range(start_value, end_value, step_size): range (1,5,1) will follow sequence, 1, 2, 3, 4."
